            As an introverted student, this portfolio is a simple space to organize 
            <a href="thoughts.html">my thoughts</a>, track <a href="task.html">
            recent tasks</a>, and share occasional insights. It's not
            fancy or driven by passion, just a practical way to document progress and 
            reflect on what I'm working on.
